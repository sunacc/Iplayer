00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
so far we'VE looked at modeling systems, AH been that have discrete dynamics, as finite state machines, and hear the picture looks something like, 

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
AH or whatever drawn here by the circles correspond to states, and all the arrows correspond to transitions between states, we also vary by, 

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
we can look at modeling systems with continuous dynamics using a formalism such as ordinary differential equations, i'm sure of that the metal pictured, 

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
you could have is that of the circles correspond to states of the continuous system which are points, in honour of a high dimensions, 

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but in an instant and dimensional space, AH various and determined by the number of a video booth, that or make up, 

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the state of the system so if you recall the helicopter example of , a if you think of the state of the helicopter is being on, the three location of the, 

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
helicopters plus up the retrieval efficiency than you could think of and as being six very odd comprises x y z coordinates, 

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and then hot data exceed a y, as he does the east, okay, AH the rule your aunts and fitch, 

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of the helicopter, right and what we see here with this quickly a red line is is basically a cough, in armed, 

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
AH in dimensional space that represents one possible evolution of the system state starting at some location that you see here, 

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and ending at some us some other point that you see here, he said so often in this particular lecture segment we're going to do, 

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
pick up in a very quick peek, at a formal system that combines discrete and continuous dynamics, of these are called, 

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000


14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
